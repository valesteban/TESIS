I know personally the first author of this book also because he is one of the editors of this journal.The first mention of this book was about 10 years ago when he started to work at the first draft. Ten years have then passed, and tens of other textbooks, books and review papers have appeared on the same topic in the meanwhile. Now that the book is published, I can perfectly understand why it took 10 years of work to finish it. The book is an encyclopaedic effort, since it presents a detailed overview of the theory and methods of network science, and covers, at the same time, the mathematics of networks as well as real-world data sets, network models and graph algorithms.}",
